# Personal Website Flask App
 ## Project Description:
 This project is a personal portfolio website built using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy (as well as some basic front end CSS and HTML). The website contains a home page that contains a brief about me sections, as well as a Skills sections and a Project section. The user can view each projects detail individually and can edit each project or add a new project. There is also an about me page with more in depth detail about my experience, background and interest. 

 ## Project Requirements:
 This project is written in Python. You will need to have python installed in order to use.

 Clone this repository to your local machine and create and activate a virtual enviornment in the project folder.

 This repository contains a file named "requirements.txt". Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project folder to install the required project dependencies.

 Run the Python file `app.py` and follow the local link created in the terminal to view the web page. 

 ## Project Learnings:
 In this project, I continued to learn more about creating Databases and Models using SQLAlchemy and also learned how to using Flask and SQLAlchemy together to create web pages and applications. I learned how to create multiple endpoints and how to use layouts and templates with flask notation to create DRY code. I also got valuable experience with some basic HTML and CSS design as I put my own flare in the style of my webpage.
