# Personal Website Flask App
 ## Project Description:
 This project is a personal portfolio website built using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy (as well as some basic front end CSS and HTML). The website contains a home page that has a brief about me section, as well as a Skills section and a Project section. The user can also view each projects detail individually for more in depth information on each project. There is also an about me page with more in depth detail about my experience, background and interests. 

 ## Project Requirements:
 This project is written in Python. You will need to have python installed in order to use.

 Clone this repository to your local machine and create and activate a virtual enviornment in the project folder.

 This repository contains a file named "requirements.txt". Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project folder to install the required project dependencies.

 Run the Python file `app.py` and follow the local link created in the terminal to view the web page. 

 ## Project Learnings:
 In this project, I continued to learn more about creating Databases and Models using SQLAlchemy and also learned how to use Flask and SQLAlchemy together to create web pages and applications. I learned how to create multiple endpoints and how to use layouts and templates with flask notation to create DRY code. I also got valuable experience with some basic HTML and CSS design as I put my own styling on the webpage.
